    <h1>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        &lt;&gt;&& Lorem                       Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
        Lorem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make<br>
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,<br>
        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially<br>
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release<br>
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br>
        and more recently with desktop publishing software<br>
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted<br>
        by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.<br>
        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal<br>
        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',<br>
        making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing<br>
        packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,<br>
        and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.<br>
        Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br>
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
